## What I do

I'm a fun, interactive skill that lets you embody iconic movie characters! I demonstrate:

- 🎬 **Character Selection** - Choose from Yoda, Tony Stark, or Sherlock Holmes
- 🎯 **Configurable Missions** - Simple config changes create different outcomes
- 🎨 **Themed Workflows** - Rich, visual scripts that match each character
- 🔄 **Dynamic Routing** - Different scripts run based on character choice
- ⚙️ **Easy Customization** - Edit one config file to change missions

This shows how skills can adapt behavior based on simple configuration changes!
